    In recent years, the price of gold has risen dramatically, sparking widespread debate about the underlying reasons. Various theories have emerged, with some attributing the increase to fluctuations in gold production, while others point to the growing demand for jewelry and other uses. In this article, we will explore the factors driving the surge in gold prices, including the dynamics of global gold mining production, the rising demand for jewelry, and other key economic influences.

  So far, in addition to modifications to title, introduction, and reference, we initially add two graphs.
  The first is the gold mine production map, and the second is the Gold ETFs Holdings by Month. 
  Both graphs contain interactive design that will be further enhanced by the next milestone.
  We integrate the given template with our graphs and texts.
  What's more, there are a couple of unfinished graphs on their way to meet everyone!

  The most challenging part of our project would be to make the graphs as satisfying and beautiful as possible.
  We also need to think twice before settling on the final page appearance and not just blindly use the template.
  In designing the Gold ETF graph, it will be challenging to design a good-looking brush that viewers can drag to see different time periods.
  It is also challenging to finish a couple of more creative, good-looking graph by the next milestone since we have limited time.
